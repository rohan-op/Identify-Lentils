# Identify-Lentils

# Lentil Classification Dataset

## Overview
This project aims to create an image dataset for the classification of three distinct objects while addressing a real-life challenge â€“ identifying various types of lentils in Indian cuisine. The dataset provides a comprehensive collection of images showcasing different varieties of lentils commonly used in Indian dishes. 

## Dataset Contents
The dataset includes meticulously curated images capturing the unique characteristics and nuances of various lentils. Each image is tagged with its corresponding lentil type, facilitating accurate classification.

## Kaggle Link
The dataset is hosted on Kaggle for easy access and exploration. You can find it here: [Lentil Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanshah47/lentils-image-dataset)

## Model Fine-Tuning
In addition to dataset creation, the project involves fine-tuning a pre-trained RESNet-50 model for classification. This step aims to enhance the model's ability to discern and categorize the diverse array of lentils represented in the dataset.
